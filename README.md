# Excel_projects
During a project where I had a supervisor guiding me in analyzing bike sales, I was fortunate to work alongside the well-known YouTuber, @Alextheanalyst. This experience helped me get better at using MS Excel for data analysis. I learned to use Excel's features like pivot tables, data visuals, and making interactive dashboards. By using these techniques to study bike sales data, I got better at finding important information in complex data.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I'm doing something called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and Pandas in Jupyter Notebook. I'm using a roller coaster dataset from Kaggle. It's a cool way for me to learn and practice my new knowledge, and I'm excited to share it with all of you. Just to be clear, this project isn't entirely my own. I learned how to do this by watching a YouTube video, so this is the outcome of that learning. I'm really grateful to the YouTuber who shared this awesome knowledge, which allowed me to learn and share it here. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is like exploring a treasure map. It helps you understand, clean, and find valuable insights in your data. With EDA, you can make smarter decisions and discover hidden gems in your information.
